<h1>Family</h1>
<p>
    My main family consists of me (Anthony), my mom, my dad, my little sister and my older brother.
    My sister currently goes to Einstein Elementary School and will be going to Jane Addams Junior High,
    then eventually Hoffman Estates High School (HEHS). My brother currently attends HEHS and is a senior.
    He went to Armstrong Elementary School for two years then transferred to Einstein, where he followed the same
    school path as stated earlier. I also go to HEHS, but I am a freshmen as this is my first year of high school.
