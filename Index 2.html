<h1>Family</h1>
    <!-- Robert Prevost helped me indent the beginning -->
<p class="tab">
    My main family consists of me (Anthony), my mom, my dad, my little sister (Amani) and my older brother (Yanni). My sister currently <br>
    goes to Einstein Elementary School and will be going to Jane Addams Junior High, then eventually Hoffman Estates High School <br>
    (HEHS). My brother currently attends HEHS and is a senior. He went to Armstrong Elementary School for two years then transferred <br>
    to Einstein, where he followed the same school path as stated earlier. I also go to HEHS, but I am a freshmen as this is my first <br>
    year of high school. I also followed the same school path as listed before. To help you understand the schools, I have a table to show you:
</p>
<!-- Table is from w3schools.com -->

    <h1>Interests</h1>
<!-- Robert Prevost helped me indent the beginning -->
    <p class="tab">
        Some of my main interests include rap music, clothing and shoes, basketball, track and field, video games, and Marvel/DC.
    </p>
<h3>Music</h3>
    <p class="tab">
        My favorite rappers include <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Y5tJX1MQlPlqiwlOH1tJY">Travis Scott</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x">Kanye West</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/699OTQXzgjhIYAHMy9RyPD">Playboi Carti</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4O15NlyKLIASxsJ0PrXPfz">Lil Uzi Vert</a>. But, I also listen to other rappers such as <br>
        <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/13ubrt8QOOCPljQ2FL1Kca">A$AP Rocky</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4r63FhuTkUYltbVAg5TQnk">DaBaby</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6fxyWrfmjcbj5d12gXeiNV">Denzel Curry</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6U3ybJ9UHNKEdsH7ktGBZ7">JID</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Ga1P7PMIsmqEZqhYZQgDo">Lil Tecca</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6oMuImdp5ZcFhWP0ESe6mG">Migos</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3zz52ViyCBcplK0ftEVPSS">Quadeca</a>. My favorite song has to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYYRKW8_pFM">"DYSTI"</a> by Travis Scott, with my <br>
        favorite album also being by Travis, titled <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4PWBTB6NYSKQwfo79I3prg">"Rodeo"</a>.

<h3>Clothing & Shoes</h3>
<!-- Robert Prevost helped me indent the beginning -->
<p class="tab">
    Another one of my passions are shoes and clothes. The reason i like them so much is because they make you look nicer, and they're <br>
    a way to express yourself. My favorite shoes are probably the <a href="https://stockx.com/nike-air-fear-of-god-1-black">Nike Air Fear of God 1s</a>, meanwhile I don't really have any particular <br>
    shirts, sweatshirts, jackets, pants, etc. that are my favorite.

<h3>Basketball</h3>
<!-- Robert Prevost helped me indent the beginning -->
<p class="tab">
    The main thing I like basketball for is watching, but I do still play from time to time. My favorite team is the <a href="https://www.nba.com/sixers/">76ers</a> <br>
    because my cousins, who introduced me to basketball, are 76ers fans. Although, my favorite player would have to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Rose">Derrick Rose</a> because <br>
    I've always liked him as a kid, even before I really knew what was going on.

<h3>Track & Field</h3>
<!-- Robert Prevost helped me indent the beginning -->
<p class="tab">
    Contrary to basketball, the main thing I like about track is participating in it. I was in track in 7th and 8th grade, and plan <br>
    to continue to do it throughout high school. I'm a sprinter, with mainly running the 100m, although I did run some long distances at meets like the <br>
    400m or the 800m.
</p>

<h3>Video Games</h3>
<!-- Robert Prevost helped me indent the beginning -->
<p class="tab">
    While I do still very much enjoy video games, I don't play them as often as I used to. This is due to homework, and also <br>
    the fact that I don't really have just one game I gravitate towards like before with <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home">Fortnite</a>. Now I play games like <a href="https://www.nba2k.com/">NBA2k</a>, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/">Call <br>
    of Duty</a>, <a href="https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/">Super Smash Bros</a>, and many others.

<h3>Marvel/DC</h3>
<!-- Robert Prevost helped me indent the beginning -->
<p class="tab">
    For Marvel, the only thing I really pay attention to and know a lot about are the movies in the <a href="https://www.marvel.com/movies">MCU</a>. Meanwhile, for DC, <br>
    I don't really like the movies, so I follow the TV shows, and used to follow the comics. My favorite Marvel super hero is Spider-Man <br>
    and my favorite DC superhero is the Flash.
